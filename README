Psyclone
=======
Psyclone is a Python 3.0 web framework originally ported from 
the scalable, non-blocking web server Tornado
available at http://www.tornadoweb.org/

Like Tornado, Psyclone is licensed under the Apache Licence, Version 2.0
(http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

Long term, I expect this project to diverge from Tornado's original design and
mission.

Chances are it won't work yet, this is just the barebones port. I need to fix
bugs, drop some unusable files, and make the examples work.
