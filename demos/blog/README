Running the Tornado Blog example app
====================================
This demo is a simple blogging engine that uses py-postgresql to store posts and
Google Accounts for author authentication. Since it depends on py-postgresql, you
need to set up postgresql and the database schema for the demo to run.

1. Install prerequisites and build psyclone

2. Install Postgresql

3. Instal py-postgresql

3. Connect to  and create a database and user for the blog.

    $ su postgres
    createuser psycloneblog
    createdb psycloneblog -U psycloneblog

4. Create the tables in your new database.

   You can use the provided schema.sql file by running this command:
   psql -U psycloneblog psycloneblog < schema.sql
   mysql --user=blog --password=blog --database=blog < schema.sql

5. Run the blog example

   With the default user, password, and database you can just run:
   ./blog.py

   If you've changed anything, you can alter the default postgres settings
   with arguments on the command line, e.g.:
   ./blog.py --db_user=casey --db_password=happiness --db_database=foodblog

6. Visit your new blog

   Open http://localhost:8888/ in your web browser. You will be redirected to
   a Google account sign-in page because the blog uses Google accounts for
   authentication.

   Currently the first user to connect will automatically be given the
   ability to create and edit posts. 

   Once you've created one blog post, subsequent users will not be
   prompted to sign in.
